		<p>I grew up in a midwestern family that cooked a lot of midwestern food. My mother's father was a beet farmer and she grew up growing all of her own food. 
			My father's father grew up in China but my grandmother did not know how to cook Chinese cuisine. Add more sentences here about food and upbringing.
